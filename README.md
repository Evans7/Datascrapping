Loading of data from google docs to SQL Chose to downlaod as CSV files, a self-contained SQL file can be found inside the main folder. The names have been kept as product1 for product_listing and group1 for group_listing.

I have considered group name as primary key in the group_listing.doc 
Similarly product serial no as primary key and group associated as foreign key referencing group name from group1 table.
